# Aion Status
Removed from Sales October, 2013.

## Unofficial Companion for Aion Online
Aion Status was an unofficial app that pulled together News, PvP Ownership, and Character Information from the official Aion Online Website into a single unified experience. Unfortunately, utilizing the website's APIs has become increasingly out of date and soon afterwards very unstable. When the APIs began returning errors the majority of the time the app was removed from sale because the user experience was so poor.
