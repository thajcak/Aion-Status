# Aion Status
Removed from Sales October, 2013. This is an archive of the application and hasn't been updated leading up to its App Store removal in 2013. It has been left in an unrefined and experimental state.

## Unofficial Companion for Aion Online
Aion Status was an unofficial app that pulled together News, PvP Ownership, and Character Information from the official Aion Online Website into a single unified experience. Unfortunately, utilizing the website's APIs has become increasingly out of date and soon afterwards very unstable. When the APIs began returning errors the majority of the time the app was removed from sale because the user experience was so poor.
